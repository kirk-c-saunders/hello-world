This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

A little about me:
- I am married with a dog and a kitten.
  - We all enjoy hanging out around the house and relaxing.
- My favorite meal is egg biryani.
- I start almost all my days with fried eggs on toast and a home made latte.
- I have become a morning person of sorts in the last year or so.
